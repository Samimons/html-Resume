<h2>Hello again.</h2>
<h3>So this is where you learn a little bit about me.</h3>
<p>I'm relatively new to the IT professional world, 
    but I am very excited to make this my new career.</p>
<p>My background is mainly from the construction industry, 
    plus a brief 7 year service as a Royal Engineer in the British Army. </p> 
<p>I should have known I'd end up in the IT sector, 
    as from a young age I dabbled in programming using 
    my first computer - the Commodore 16, with tape deck (yes i know I'm old lol).</p>

<p>I have always loved computers and technology, 
    making several gaming pc's for my friends, family and myself over the years.</p>
<p>I just love to learn and get bored if I'm not learning or researching something new.</p>

<h3>Everybody has hobbies, here's mine...</h3>
<h4>Reading</h4>
<p>Generally I have 2 books on the go, 1 audiobook when im driving or walking my dogs, 
    and the other, a kindle book to get me of to sleep.
    Currently, I just can't get enough of zombie stories or space saga's, I absolutely love them.</p>
<h4>Music</h4>
<p>Kylie Minogue, Steps...only joking lol, nothing wrong with them, just not my cup of tea.
    I am lucky enough to own a really good set of headphones and amplifier/DAC 
    and can float away for hours listening to the likes of Teddy Swims or Radiohead amongst a million. </p>
<h4>Sport</h4>
<p>In a previous life I must have been a fish, as I love anything to do with water, 
    windsurfing and water skiiing are my favourites. I like to keep fit and enjoy the personal challenge of weight lifting. 
    Golf, my nemesis, if there was ever a sport that I wish wasn't invented, then golf it is, 
    I am terrible, but yet I play on lol, 4 to 5 hours of torture only to be repeated the next time I play a round.</p>
